## üöÄ Running Instructions

 - 1. From your computer, clone my repository with all the files included (dfa_minimizer.py, input.txt, and the README.md file).

 - 2. After cloning, open the terminal and run the command:
python dfa_minimizer.py
(Preferably do this from Visual Studio Code). This will display the result of the program execution.

 - 3. The file input.txt is the program‚Äôs input. I have already included a test case that will work when you run it.
However, if you want to test the program with another example, follow these instructions to provide a new input:

c
n
alphabet_symbols
final_states
transition_row_0
transition_row_1
...
transition_row_n-1

- `c`: number of test cases (DFAs).  
- `n`: number of states in the DFA.  
- `alphabet_symbols`: alphabet symbols separated by spaces.  
- `final_states`: final states separated by spaces.  
- Each transition row corresponds to one state and contains the destination states in the same order as the alphabet symbols.
